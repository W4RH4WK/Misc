# Utilities for / in C

These are some utilities written in C for personal use, they are not tested and
might fail horribly. I do not recommend including them in your project, there
are better alternatives available elsewhere.

## Data Structures

- `array` implements a dynamic array which can be resized.
- `list` implements a double linked listed.

## Adapters

- `stack` stack adapter for `array`.
