        <p>Files in the gallery are organized via tags, each file can
        have multiple tags. Thumbnails are automatically created upon
        upload. If he automatic thumbnail creating fails, you can
        recreate all with one click</p>
        
        <h4>Thumbnail</h4>
        <blockquote>
            A thumbnail is a smaller version of a picture used for
            preview. The smaller version ensures fast loading, rather
            than waiting for a shrinked 24 megapixel Image.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>File Upload</h4>
        <blockquote>
            You can upload a single file via your browser, by clicking
            the "Upload File" button.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Multiple File Upload</h4>
        <blockquote>
            For multiple file upload, i recommend uploading the files
            via FTP or something like that, and recreate all
            thumbnails after the upload has been completed.

        <h4>Tags</h4>
        <blockquote>
            Tags are used to organize files. Each file can
            be <i>tagged</i> with multiple tags. When a new tag is
            created, select the files you wish to tag.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Remove a Tags</h4>
        <blockquote>
            Simply click on a tag and hit the remove button.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h4>Tags</h4>
        <blockquote>
            Go a head and click a file name to delete this file.
