# A Minimalistic CMS [DEPRECATED]

### Description
This project stays in direct contrast to AS-CMS. While AS-CMS features an admin
panel as well as easy "in-browser administration", AM-CMS does not have such
features. All creating, content changing, deleting, is done via creating,
editing, deleting files.

No database is need, because every bit of information is stored in a file. All
you need for this CMS is an editor and a ftp client (depending on where the CMS
is stored)

This project is dedicated to programmers which need a simple / basic framework
for their web site.

Alternatively AM-CMS can be used for static pages.

The idea behind is, is the UNIX philosophy:  
"do one thing and do it well"

### AS-CMS
Stands for Another Stupid CMS and is one of my projects.  
<https://github.com/W4RH4WK/AS-CMS>

### Installation
 - Just put the files on your webspace.
 - add, edit, remove content according to the components

### Components
Components are like plugins. Each component has it's own way of doing things
and it's own purpose. View the component's `main.php` for documentation.

### Documentation
Because this project is dedicated to programmers, all documentation will be
located *at the beginning of* / *within* the source code.

### Structure
The structure of this project is similar to AS-CMS.
